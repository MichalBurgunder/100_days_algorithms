# DYNAMIC TIME WARPING

# this algorithm is very similar to that of the Levenshtein distance algorithm,
# with the exception that the Levenshtein distance computes the exact, linear
# offset. Dynamic timewarping however decides how much two continuous curves/
# arrays with non-integer values are unaligned. The method contructs a dynamic
# programming matrix, and then fills out the matrix, just as before, with the
# distances. Each step taken is compared to other paths, so that the minimum
# distance between to curves can be achieved, instead of the absolute minimum
# number of changes needing to be done, to align two strings.
