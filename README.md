## Getting Started

Each algorithm has been saved in their own file, which are present in several different programming languages. The only exception to this rule is for Java files, which are present in numbered folders, in which an appropriately named class file is present. This allows for consistent naming. Each file has been created and documented for easy read-through, so that __zero__ changes are requires to the file to run it. This way, one can run the files without any inputs. For those files requiring images, basic images have been provided. The intructions to run each file type follow:

### MacOS

Python and Node should both be preinstalled on your computer. For Julia, you'll have to install it manually via `brew install julia`. For Java, you will need to install a runtime for it, such as [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/18/). You might also want to download a UI for Java. I'd recommend an IDE like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?fromIDE=#section=mac) (payment/trial required), or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) (free), although you can also run Java from the command line as well. Compiling Java classes can come with a load of pain and frustration, if using mulitple classes and .JAR files, although I've omitted this added complexity where I could.

The below table are a list of instructions for running any file in this repo in the shell, when you are located in any level-1 folder. 


| Language   | First Command                   | Second Command                 |
|------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Python     | `python [filename].py`          |                                |
| JavaScript | `node [filename].js`            |                                |
| Julia      | `julia [filename].js`           |                                |
| C          | `gcc [filename].c`              | `./a.out`                      |
| C++        | `g++ [filename].cpp`            | `./a.out`                      |
| Java       | `javac [number]/[filename].java`| `java [number]/[filename].java`|


### Windows

TODO

#### Linux

MacOS and Linux both use the Linux kernel, hence why the commands should be more or less the same.
