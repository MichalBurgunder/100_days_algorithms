# DYNAMIC TIME WARPING

# TODO: need to make distance the hypotenuse
# this algorithm is very similar to that of the Levenshtein distance algorithm, but its use is slightly different. While the Levenshtein distance works on only discrete values, dynamic time warping can decide how much two continuous curves/arrays with fractional values are unaligned. The method contructs a dynamic programming matrix, and then fills out the matrix, just as before, with the distances. Each step taken is compared to other paths, so that the minimum distance between to curves can be achieved.

    # with no points, the curves are perfectly aligned
